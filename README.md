# Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree Projects

This repository contains the projects that I did for the Data Engineering Nanodegree by Udacity.

## Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres

In this project, I modeled user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. I created a relational database in PostgreSQL, defined Fact and Dimension tables, and ETL pipeline with Python designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to.

## Project 2: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

In this project, I modeled user activity data to allow for specific queries provided by the analytics team at Sparkify. I created a NoSQL database in Apache Cassandra and ETL pipeline with Python designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to.

## Project 3: Build a Cloud Data Warehouse

In this project, I tasked with building an ETL pipeline with Python that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Project 4: Build a Data Lake

In this project, I tasked with building an ETL pipeline for a data lake that loads data from S3, processes the data into analytics tables using Spark deployed as a process on an AWS EMR cluster, and load them back into S3. The data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in the app.

## Project 5: Data Pipelines with Airflow

In this project, I continued my work on the music streaming companyâ€™s data infrastructure by creating and automating a set of data pipelines. I configured and scheduled data pipelines with Airflow and monitor and debug production pipelines.
